# Corali Task App Backend

The backend API for the Corali Task App, providing robust task management functionalities including creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion of tasks.

## Project Description

This repository contains the backend service for the Corali Task App, built to support a modern task management frontend application. It exposes a RESTful API that allows clients to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. The backend is designed to handle data persistence, business logic, and API interactions, ensuring a reliable and scalable foundation for the task application. It's built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, offering a lightweight and efficient server-side solution.

## Key Features

- **RESTful API:** Provides a well-defined set of API endpoints for task management.
- **Task CRUD Operations:** Supports creating new tasks, fetching all tasks, retrieving specific tasks, updating task details, and deleting tasks.
- **Data Persistence:** Handles storing task data (likely in a database).
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed with modularity in mind to facilitate future expansion.
- **Environment Configuration:** Supports flexible configuration using environment variables.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** Includes npm (Node Package Manager). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).  
  _It's recommended to use the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version._
- **npm** (comes bundled with Node.js) or **Yarn** (optional):  
  Yarn can be installed globally via npm:  
  ```
  npm install -g yarn
  ```
- **Database System:**  
  (If the app requires data persistence beyond in-memory)  
  For example, a MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based), PostgreSQL, etc.  
  If a database is used, ensure it is running and accessible.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kaif77/corali-task-app-be.git
    cd corali-task-app-be
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Using Yarn (if installed):
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables (if applicable):**

    If the project uses environment variables (e.g., for database connection strings, port numbers, etc.), create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.  
    A `.env.example` file might be provided as a template in the repository.

    Example `.env` content (adjust as per actual project requirements):
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/corali_tasks
    # Add any other necessary environment variables here
    ```

## How to Run

Start the development server after installing dependencies and configuring environment variables.

Using npm:
```bash
npm start
```

Or, for development with live-reloading (if `nodemon` is configured in `package.json`):
```bash
npm run dev
```

Using Yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```

Or, for development with live-reloading:
```bash
yarn dev
```

The server will typically start on the port specified in your `.env` file (e.g., [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)).  
You can use tools like **Postman**, **Insomnia**, or a simple `curl` command to test the API endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js:** Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Database:** (e.g., MongoDB/Mongoose or PostgreSQL/Sequelize) for data persistence.  
  _Specific database depends on implementation._
- **dotenv:** For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **Other Libraries:** Depending on implementation, could include `cors`, `body-parser`, `nodemon` (for development), etc.
